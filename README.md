# css-framework-challenge
## Instructions
Choose a framework. For this exercise it's better to start with a component-first framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma, rather than a utility-first framework such as Tailwind.
Using exclusively the classes provided by your framework, try to get as close as possible to the layout provided. Don't write any custom CSS.
Deploy on the system of your choice (GitHub Pages or Netlify)

## Instructions
Choose a framework. If you don't have a lot of experience, start with a component-first framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma. If you want to dare you can start with a utility-first framework such as Tailwind, but beware that it might require extra time to set up.
You can find similar icons for free at https://www.flaticon.com/home (it's ok if they are not exactly the same: the layout, positioning and dimensions is what counts!)
Find a similar font on https://fonts.google.com/ (it's ok if it's not exactly the same, but try to respect font size, color, etc.)
First, try to get as close as possible without writing any CSS. Start from the general structure (a responsive grid with rectangular "cards" inside), then proceed with the inner structure of each card.
Once there isn't anything more you can "extract" from the framework of your choice, you can start adding custom CSS
