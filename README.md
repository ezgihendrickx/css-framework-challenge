# css-framework-challenge
## Instructions
Choose a framework. For this exercise it's better to start with a component-first framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma, rather than a utility-first framework such as Tailwind.
Using exclusively the classes provided by your framework, try to get as close as possible to the layout provided. Don't write any custom CSS.
Deploy on the system of your choice (GitHub Pages or Netlify)
